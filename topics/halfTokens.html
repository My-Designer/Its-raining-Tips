        This is one of three settings in which you choose a number.
      </p>
      <p>
        That number cannot be lower than 20.
      </p>
      <p>
        The proposed number is 200. You can choose another number if you like.

        More tokens cause more rain, up to a limit defined by the previous setting.
        This setting determines how fast higher tips approach that limit.
      </p>
      <p>
        A medium sized rainfall is half of the limit, in other words:
        Half of the largest possible rainfall.
        This setting defines how many tokens are needed to get a medium sized rainfall.
        Less tokens cause less rain, just like a visitor would expect.
        More tokens cause slightly more rain,
        up to the limit defined in the previous setting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here you see how settings and the amount of tokens tipped affect the rain size:
