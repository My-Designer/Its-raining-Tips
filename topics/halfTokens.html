        This is one of three settings in which you choose a number.
      </p>
      <p>
        That number cannot be lower than 20.
      </p>
      <p>
        The proposed number is 200. You can choose another number if you like.

        More tokens cause more rain, and the amount of rain is bounded.
        This option determines how fast high tips approach that boundary.
      </p>
      <p>
        You define how many tokens are needed to get half of the largest possible rain.
        Up to that amount of tokens, visitors easily see that more tokens cause more rain.
        Above that amount of tokens, even higher tips cause just a little bit more rain.
        The nearer they get to the highest possible rain, the harder it becomes to get more rain.

        Itâ€™s a bit like a ðŸš€ rocket approaching the speed of âš¡ light,
        just in case you are familiar with the Theory of Relativity:
        No rocket can ever reach the speed of light,
        and the closer it gets to that speed,
        the harder it becomes to gain more speed.

        In case you are less familiar with the Theory of Relativity, just watch tokens and rain here:
